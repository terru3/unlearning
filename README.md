# Machine Unlearning

This repository contains implementations of machine unlearning (MU) algorithms such as [Amnesiac Unlearning (Graves et al. 2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10981), zero-glance and zero-shot unlearning via [error-maximizing noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08947) and [gated knowledge transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05629), exploring the nascent field of MU and its applications in _right to be forgotten_, federated learning, catastrophic forgetting, debiasing, influence functions and model interpretability, and more.
