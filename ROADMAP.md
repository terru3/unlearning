| Status | Item                                                                                                                                     |
| :----: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   ✔    | Create README and ROADMAP                                                                                                                |
|   ✔    | Implement Fisher-based unlearning such as selective synaptic dampening (Fisher forgetting not done)                                      |
|   ✔    | Implement incompetent-teacher unlearning                                                                                                 |
|   ❌   | Implement verification tests such as membership inference attacks or model inversion attacks                                             |
|   ❌   | Implement Amnesiac Unlearning and _Unlearning_ from AmnesiacML                                                                           |
|   ❌   | Implement zero-glance unlearning via error-maximizing noise (UNSIR)                                                                              |
|   ❌   | Implement evaluation metrics such as unlearn and relearn time, zero retrain forgetting (ZRF), anamnesis index (AIN), JS divergence, etc. |
|   ❌   | Implement zero-shot unlearning via gated knowledge transfer                                                                              |
