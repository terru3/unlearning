# Machine Unlearning

This repository contains implementations of machine unlearning (MU) algorithms such as [Amnesiac Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10981), zero-glance and zero-shot unlearning via [error-maximizing noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08947) and [gated knowledge transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05629) respectively, [selective synaptic dampening (SSD)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07707), [incompetent teacher unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08096), etc., exploring the nascent field of MU and its applications in the _right to be forgotten_, debiasing, influence functions and model interpretability, and more.
